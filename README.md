<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> :pencil: About The Project</h2>

<p align="justify"> The aim of the project is to create an image dataset of minerals and rocks and train a model for their classification.
    The images are recovered through web scraping and from personal collections. After having downloaded them, each category is checked by hand to eliminate any non-compliant images

- [ ] Clean the dataset (working on). First partial cleaning,
- [ ] Train the model (python) and covert it for tensorflow js
- [ ] Image pre-processing 
- [ ] Data augmentation
- [ ] Model
    - [ ] Develop a baseline
    - [ ] Train the model
    - [ ] Hyperparameter tuning?
    - [ ] Converto it for tensorflow js
 - [ ] Develop Angular WebApp

| Model Type                | Classes            | Description                                                                           |
|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CNN from scratch  model_1 | Quartz, Pyrite (2) | Start Simple - Build a custom CNN baseline model for a binary classification problem. |
| Fine - Tuning  model_2    | Quartz, Pyrite (2) | Take the weights of a pretrained model and fine-tune to my problem.                   |
| CNN from scratch  model_3 | 10                 | Same as model_1 but now its a multiclass problem                                      |
| Fine - Tuning  model_4    | 10                 | Same as model_2 but now its a multiclass problem                                      |
