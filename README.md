<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> :pencil: About The Project</h2>

<p align="justify"> The aim of the project is to create an image dataset of minerals and rocks and train a model for their classification.
    The images are recovered through web scraping and from personal collections. After having downloaded them, each category is checked by hand to eliminate any non-compliant images
